This project explores Germany’s CO₂ emissions using public data from Our World in Data.
It focuses on loading real-world data, filtering it with pandas, and visualizing trends using Matplotlib.

The notebook includes line, scatter, bar, pie, and histogram plots to show how Germany’s emissions have changed over time and how different energy sources contribute to total CO₂.

Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib
Data source: Our World in Data (CO₂ dataset)
